# Multiplication-Quiz
A multiplication quizzer with a timer

A simple windows form in VB.net to help learn multiplication factors.
The user can set the maximum factor and the number of problems that
they want (20, 30, 40, or 50). When started, the current problem is
displayed, and focus is on the answer textbox. Answers are submitted
by the Space key. After each submission, if the correct answer is given,
the score increments. After the quiz, a grade is displayed along with
an encouraging message, and the elapsed time.

Future additions could include an option to show the time during the
quiz, using the time as part of the grading factor, and keeping track
of a user's score with feedback.
